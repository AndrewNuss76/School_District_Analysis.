# School_District_Analysis.
Leveraging Jupyter

## Overview of School District Analysis
The intent of this analysis was to leverage jupyter notebook for python, specifically using pandas for the analysis. The analysis focused on reading and cleaning up multiple data sets that would ultimately be used to help analyze school ratings for math and reading scores. This type of analysis is very helpful with being able to identify brightspots within the district when it comes to performance. This could also have impact on overall budgets due to testing performance.

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
- there are a total of 15 schools that have a net budget of $24M. The average scores are:
-Reading - 82%
-Math - 79%

- When we look at the district overall, the overall passing % is 65%

### How is the school summary affected?

### How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schools' performance relative to the other schools?
- Thomas High Schools overall passing % was 65%, their overall reading and math scores were 86% and 75%, respectively. When we look at overall performance compared to the other schools, Thomas High School falls towards the middle as it's not in the top or bottom performers. If you were to exclude the 9th graders, performance for Thomas High School would be significantly higher. This tells us that testing for reading and math needs to be a priority for the 9th grade. By excluding the 9th grade, the overall passing percentage is ~91%

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

#### Math and reading Scores by Grade:
-by focusing on the Grade, you can identify which grade across the different schools is high and bottom performing
#### Scores by school spending
-We can identify which schools are spending the most amount of money on testing. If school is spending a high budget, and scores are low, the quality of the testing is not ideal
#### Scores by school size
- this is just another dimension to identify which school sizes might be more favorable with testing
#### Scores by school type
-similar to size, we can identify if private or public schools are better with testing.
